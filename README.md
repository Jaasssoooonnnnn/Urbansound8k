## 📋 Overview & Crucial Data Protocols

This project is the winning solution for the "Echoes of the City" competition. The goal was to classify 10 categories of urban sounds from the **UrbanSound8K** dataset (e.g., engine_idling, gun_shot, siren) under strict constraints.

### ⚠️ Strict Training Standards
We emphasize that all results in this repository are based on rigorous evaluation standards:
* **No Pre-training:** All models are trained entirely **from scratch**.
* **Official Splits:** We strictly utilized the **Official UrbanSound8K Data Folds**.
* **No Reshuffling:** We did **NOT** reshuffle the data. Reshuffling eliminates the "in-the-wild" nature of the dataset and causes data leakage.

## 💡 Method & Performance Analysis

Our pipeline leverages **Trainable PCEN**, **FiLM Metadata Fusion**, and **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)**.

### Model Performance Comparison
* **ResNet-34:** Achieved the **best performance** among the ResNet family and served as our primary baseline.
* **DenseNet121, Res2Net-50, WideResNet-50:** These architectures also performed well and contributed significantly to the final ensemble.
* **ConvNeXt (Failed):** We experimented with ConvNeXt, but it performed poorly. We attribute this to the small dataset size; ConvNeXt lacks the strong **inductive bias** of standard CNNs, making it difficult to generalize without pre-training on this specific task.

### 🚩 Critical Note on Reproducibility (Failed Papers)
We attempted to reproduce the architectures and methods from the following papers. However, our results (using strict official folds without pre-training) were **far lower** than the values claimed in these articles. We **seriously suspect data leakage** (likely due to random shuffling of the dataset) in their experiments:
1.  *FACE: Fast, Accurate and Context-Aware Audio Annotation and Classification*
2.  *Environment Sound Classification Using a Two-Stream CNN Based on Decision-Level Fusion*
3.  *End-to-End Environmental Sound Classification using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network*
